# Scratchpad

I'm thinking that MCP is the up-and-coming trend for AI land, so the webinar I'm proposing is just going to cover how to add MCP server functionality to a traditional back-end API web server. 

Should be good for beginners that know coding already, but not good for beginners that have never done any back-end coding before. 

The idea for this webinar is that it's about how to ensure back-end work stays relevant and up-to-date when everyone around you is hyperfocused on AI & LLMs.

Should look to the AWS Workshop projects for examples of their content delivery - walkthroughs that instruct attendees to uncomment larger code blocks, or make smaller code modifications. No coding from scratch due to the short timeframe.

Branches for different milestones in the workshop, to help those who face any issues or get otherwise stuck on something.
