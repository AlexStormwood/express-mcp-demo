URL: [https://www.acs.org.au/cpd-education/event-detail.html?eventId=701Om00000Pip5FIAR](https://www.acs.org.au/cpd-education/event-detail.html?eventId=701Om00000Pip5FIAR)

In this workshop, we'll cover developing MCP servers within back-end web server APIs, using ExpressJS applications as an example.

## Delivery

- 1x 1 hour session.
- Online session.

### Session Skeletons

#### Session 1

- 10-15 minutes on establishment of concepts
	- Poll the class on skill/experience levels

- 10-15 minutes on questions 

## Target Audience

- Beginner or junior-level back-end developers.
	- Short timeframe -> don't want to be walking through the basics of an ExpressJS server.
	- Can't assume too much - still show and/or provide the foundational stuff in the code-along project.

## Learning Outcomes



## Workshop Blurb

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more-advanced, able to retrieve data from external sources and allow users to perform complex actions with natural language. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the next step up from that: it’s a protocol that allows a LLM to interact with other software, such as your API or web server. This has huge potential for any business that provides software as a service - imagine how easy it could be for users to use your software if they can do it from the comfort of their LLM client!

MCP appears in popular LLM clients such as Visual Studio Code Copilot, though some LLM clients give MCP a different name - such as ChatGPT using “Connectors” instead. Either way, this protocol allows LLM clients to interact with software, enabling so much more functionality and features for users.

In this workshop, we’ll dig into how MCP servers can be developed within back-end web server APIs, such as ExpressJS applications. Throughout the webinar, you will:
- Learn what the Model Context Protocol is and why it’s useful.
- Understand the architecture and design requirements of an MCP server and how it compares to a typical web server or API.
- Explore the use cases for running an MCP server within your APIs or web servers.
- Be able to adapt existing code in a back-end API project to be used by an MCP server.
- See how popular LLM clients can make use of your MCP server locally and remotely.
